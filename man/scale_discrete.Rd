\title{Position scales for discrete data}
\usage{
scale_x_discrete(..., expand = waiver(), position = "bottom")

scale_y_discrete(..., expand = waiver(), position = "left")
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{common discrete scale parameters: \code{name}, \code{breaks},
\code{labels}, \code{na.value}, \code{limits} and \code{guide}.  See
\code{\link{discrete_scale}} for more details}

\item{expand}{Vector of range expansion constants used to add some
padding around the data, to ensure that they are placed some distance
away from the axes. Use the convenience function \code{\link{expand_scale}}
to generate the values for the \code{expand} argument. The defaults are to
expand the scale by 5\% on each side for continuous variables, and by
0.6Â units on each side for discrete variables.}

\item{position}{The position of the axis. \code{left} or \code{right} for y
axes, \code{top} or \code{bottom} for x axes}
}
\description{
You can use continuous positions even with a discrete position scale -
this allows you (e.g.) to place labels between bars in a bar chart.
Continuous positions are numeric values starting at one for the first
level, and increasing by one for each level (i.e. the labels are placed
at integer positions).  This is what allows jittering to work.

\examples{
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut)) + geom_bar()

\donttest{
# The discrete position scale is added automatically whenever you
# have a discrete position.

(d <- ggplot(subset(diamonds, carat > 1), aes(cut, clarity)) +
      geom_jitter())

d + scale_x_discrete("Cut")
d + scale_x_discrete("Cut", labels = c("Fair" = "F","Good" = "G",
  "Very Good" = "VG","Perfect" = "P","Ideal" = "I"))

# Use limits to adjust the which levels (and in what order)
# are displayed
d + scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Fair","Ideal"))

# you can also use the short hand functions xlim and ylim
d + xlim("Fair","Ideal", "Good")
d + ylim("I1", "IF")

# See ?reorder to reorder based on the values of another variable
ggplot(mpg, aes(manufacturer, cty)) + geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(reorder(manufacturer, cty), cty)) + geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(reorder(manufacturer, displ), cty)) + geom_point()

# Use abbreviate as a formatter to reduce long names
ggplot(mpg, aes(reorder(manufacturer, displ), cty)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = abbreviate)
